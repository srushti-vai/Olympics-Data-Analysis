    "The overlapping_athletes_df above is very interesting in the fact that it covers athletes that have competed in both the Summer and the Winter Olympics. It starts by merging the winter_df and the summer_df on the 'Name' column, using the 'inner' merge technique. This allows us to only retain the rows with athletes who have a name under the summer_df and winter_df. However, upon initially analyzing this data, we noticed that some of the athletes had a lengthy gap between their Summer and Winter record (ex. a Summer record 40-60 years apart from their Winter record). This made us realize that there are several athletes with the same name. For this reason, to make the data more accurate, we filtered the data to include only the rows with the Summer year and Winter year value to be within 20 years of each other, as an average athlete won't attend more than 5 Olympic cycles in their lifetime. This filtered the data to be more accurate, such as Lauryn Williams, shown above, who participated in both bobsleigh and athletics. Some of the data however, may still be inaccurate, as several people have had the same names, as well as the fact that for several years, some of the Winter Sports were held along side the Summer Sports. However, generally, this merged and filtered data set well represents the data of athletes who have participated in both the Winter and Summer Olympics. There are 275 unique athletes in this data frame who have participated in both seasons."
